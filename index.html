			<h2>A Few of My Famous Inspirational Quotes</h2>
			<p>
				<img src="smart.jpg" width="139" height="150" style="margin: 0 10px 10px 0;float:left;" />
				<em>" I'm ugly and I'm proud"</em> - Me<br/>
                <em>"Do you smell it? That smell, the kind of smelly smell. A smelly smell that smells... smelly."</em> - Me<br/>
				<em>"CHOCOLATE!!!"</em> - Me<br/>
				<em>"I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, but that really means he's messing it up. But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means, Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's Spongebob!"</em> - Me<br/>
